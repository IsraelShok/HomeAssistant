# Broadlink Sample DB

These sample files are provided for reference only. You may be able to use them and add to them however it's not something I have tested.

* There are two RM devices with MAC addresses assigned in the jsonDevice file.
* There are two Air conditioning units configured in the jsonSubIr file.
* There are a number of buttons configured for each Air Conditioner in the jsonButton file.
* There are some sample IR Codes in the jsonIrCode file. (These are for a Mitsubishi Air conditioner)

Hope it is useful.
